## Data Compiled by Bike West Hartford, last updated June 2023
- https://app.placemark.io/public/wCRAP2DACjNUsCdeS9AeP
- see also download: bicycle-network.geojson
- BWH design emphasizes protected paths, painted lanes, mixed (lane on one side, sharrow on other side), and popular routes. We do not emphasize "sharrows only" because these are inadequate bike infrastructure.

## Data Sources
- Town of West Hartford CT: GIS Mapping System, Bicycle Network, Existing Routes and Recreational Routes https://westhartfordct.mapgeo.io/datasets/properties
- City of Hartford Bike Routes https://openhartford-hartfordgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bike-routes/explore?location=41.775340%2C-72.674067%2C13.00  
- and City of Hartford Planning Viewer, Bike Routes https://gis1.hartford.gov/Html5Viewer/index.html?viewer=PlanningViewer
IMPORTANT: Since Hartford marks bike lanes on both sides, removed one side to match West Hartford (for centerline distance). Also changed Hartford column headers and field names to match (Bike Lane to lane, etc.)
